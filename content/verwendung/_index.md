### Hosting and software deployment
- This software is written in Python, and uses open-source libraries, which are fully suited for commercial use.

- We are using Nginx and Gunicorn to host the software.

- It should be possible for anyone to deploy the website in about 10 minutes without coding knowledge. A guide will be sent with every purchase of the Stimmungskompass software.

#### Remote project management (by developer)
This only has to do with making adjustments to the project, Admin of the Gemeinde has remote access regardless of hosting location.

- In case you decide to host the software on your own server, the developer will require SSH access to the server to manage the project. This is only necessary if you want adjustments.
- In case you choose hosting by us, this is not necessary.
